# easyDockerDeploy
This is an easy deployment platform for Docker that runs from the console on a Linux distro (preferably Ubuntu or derived).

In order to deploy the environment make sure you have a stable Linux installed with Internet access.
Your system must have the following packages installed as well: build-essential, docker-toolbox, python and pip.

If all is OK then just run runme.sh like this: "./runme.sh" (without the double quotes)

Once the setup finishes the system bootstraps. The centralized log can be found at: easy/central_log.txt.
The system checks also for inconsistencies and delivers an error-free/smooth experience. It checks for running instances and logs accordingly.

I hope you like it.

Enjoy!
